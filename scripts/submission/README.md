### Work flow of the simulation setup
1. Starting from the AT configuration, expand the value of the frist umbrella coordinate (UC1: distance between cog of A-elbow and P-elbow) from 6.3nm to a set of equally spaced values (3.0 to 7.0 with a step of 0.2)
```
sbatch submit.short.bash
```
then
```
sbatch submit.short-2.bash 
```

2. After the first step, for each given value of UC1 from 4.0 to 7.0, expand the value of the second umbrella coordinate (UC2: distance between cog of A-elbow and cog of L14) to a set of equally spaced value (5.0 to 8.0 with a step of 1)
```
sbatch submit.multiX.many
```
3. Run umbrella sampling runs from the starting configurations generated by step 1, 2
```
sbatch submit.long.many2
```
4. Analyze the simulation result and calculate the free-energy map using WHAM (instructions to be finished)
